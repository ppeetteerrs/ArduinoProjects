Delivering Traditional and Omnidirectional Media
</a>

</div>
<div class='panel-collapse collapse' id='collapse-1'>
<div class='panel-body'>
<h4 class='tutorial-heading'>Abstract</h4>
<p>Universal media access as proposed in the late 90s is now closer to reality. Users can generate, distribute and consume almost any media content, anywhere, anytime and with/on any device. A major technical breakthrough was the adaptive streaming over HTTP resulting in the standardization of MPEG-DASH, which is now successfully deployed in most platforms. The next challenge in adaptive media streaming is virtual reality applications and, specifically, omnidirectional (360°) media streaming.</p>
<p>This tutorial first presents a detailed overview of adaptive streaming of both traditional and omnidirectional media, and focuses on the basic principles and paradigms for adaptive streaming. New ways to deliver such media are explored and industry practices are presented. The tutorial then continues with an introduction to the fundamentals of communications over 5G and looks into mobile multimedia applications that are newly enabled or dramatically enhanced by 5G.</p>
<p>A dedicated section in the tutorial covers the much-debated issues related to quality of experience. Additionally, the tutorial provides insights into the standards, open research problems and various efforts that are underway in the streaming industry.</p>

<h4 class='tutorial-heading'>Abstract</h4>
<p>Optical See-Through Augmented Reality, as supported by devices like Meta 2, Hololens, etc., provides a new medium. In this tutorial we will introduce the benefits of optical see-through AR over video see-through AR, which you could get by adding a video camera to a VR headset. We will also discuss the benefits over wearable AR over cellphone-powered AR, such as that your hands are free and are available as natural input devices, and that the AR graphics is directly registered with your vision. We will demonstrate various AR applications, and we will show how you can create your own using Meta SDK.</p>

Trends and Recent Developments in Video Coding Standardization
</a>
</h4>
</div>
<div class='panel-collapse collapse' id='collapse-3'>
<div class='panel-body'>
<h4 class='tutorial-heading'>Abstract</h4>
<p>While HEVC is the state‐of‐the‐art video compression standard with profiles addressing virtually all video‐related products of today, the next generation of standards is already taking shape, showing significant performance improvements relative to this established technology. At the same time, the target application space evolves further towards higher picture resolution, higher dynamic range, fast motion capture, or previously unaddressed formats such as 360° video. The signal properties of this content open the door for different designs of established coding tools as well as the introduction of new algorithmic concepts which have not been applied in the context of video coding before. Specifically, the required ultra‐high picture resolutions and the projection operations in the context of processing VR/360° video provide exciting options for new developments.</p>
<p>This tutorial will provide a comprehensive overview on recent developments and perspectives in the area of video coding. As a central element, the work performed in the Joint Video Exploration Team (JVET) of ITU‐T SG16/Q6 (VCEG) and ISO/IEC JTC1 SC29WG11 (MPEG) is covered, but trends outside of the tracks of standardization bodies are considered as well. By the time of the tutorial, results of the Call for Proposals on the next generation video compression standard will be available, and technologies under consideration for establishing a test model will be reported. Subjective and objective quality assessment of new approaches in comparison to HEVC will be discussed as well. The focus of the tutorial is on algorithms, tools and concepts for future video compression technology with significantly increased performance. In this context, also the potential of methods related to perceptional models, synthesis of perceptional equivalent content, higher precision of motion compensation, and deep learning based approaches will be discussed.</p>

Multimedia and Language: Bridging Multimedia and Natural Language with Deep Learning
</a>
</h4>

<div class='panel-collapse collapse' id='collapse-4'>
<div class='panel-body'>
<h4 class='tutorial-heading'>Abstract</h4>
<p>Recognition of visual content has been a fundamental challenge in computer vision and multimedia for decades, where previous research predominantly focused on understanding visual content using a predefined yet limited vocabulary. Thanks to the recent development of deep learning techniques, researchers in both computer vision and multimedia communities are now striving to bridge multimedia with natural language, which can be regarded as the ultimate goal of visual understanding. We will present recent advances in exploring the synergy of multimedia content understanding and language processing techniques, including multimedia-language alignment, visual captioning and commenting, visual emotion analysis, visual question answering, visual storytelling, and as well as open issues for this emerging research area.</p>
