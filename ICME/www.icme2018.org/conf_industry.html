XR: virtual, augmented and mixed reality
</a>

<div class='panel-collapse collapse' id='collapse-2'>
<div class='panel-body'>
<h4 class='specsess-heading'>Synopsis</h4>
<p>
XR, or X Reality, encompasses many means of combining digital and real-world realities. XR applications can take different forms, such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and more. XR users generate new forms of reality by bringing digital objects into the physical world and bringing physical world objects into the digital world. XR has applications in many industries, including architecture, real estate, health care, retail, travel, media and entertainment, marketing, education, enterprise, and so on.
</p>
<p>
To truly bring out the sense of reality, XR experience must be delivered at the highest quality. This puts significant demands on the processing speed and power of hardware and software implementations and on the bandwidth required for high quality delivery. Advanced capturing, processing, compression and display technologies (sensors, displays, and infrastructures) need to be developed. Companies large and small are innovating to improve the XR ecosystem. International standardization development organizations such as ISO/IEC MPEG and ITU-T/VCEG have also taken up the tasks of defining compression and delivery standards to enable interoperability among XR applications.
</p>
<p>
At ICME 2018, we’re excited to announce the panel discussion on “XR: Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality.” We have invited a list of outstanding panelists, who will cover a wide range of topics related to XR, from content creation to light field displays in labs, and from hardware and software implementations to the latest and upcoming international standards. Please be sure to join our panel discussion to be held on Wednesday July 25th, 2018.

<h4 class='specsess-heading'>Abstract</h4>
<p>
The widely anticipated 5G cellular specifications, 3GPP Release 15, are here. Deployments are starting, devices will appear soon, and there’s plenty of buzz about who’s first, who’s best and what is to come.  5G brings great promises of 20 Gbps data rates, 1 ms latency, long battery life, and network enhancements: a Service Based Architecture, Network Function Virtualization, and Network Slicing.  But what does it all mean and what is to come? Are we overly enthusiastic, or are those who are ambivalent or skeptical justified? 
</p>
<p>
This talk will take a brief look at the evolution of cellular standards, the expectations, the successes, and the failures. It will then focus on how 5G is different and discuss how success will follow from leveraging the flexible 5G technologies for a larger ecosystem that can benefit from the broadband continuous coverage of cellular networks. Advanced multimedia services are one of the most important use cases. Yet, success may also depend on high performance localized applications using mobile edge computing, IoT, new entrants operating in unlicensed spectrum, contributions to the automobile industry’s plans for autonomous and assisted driving, non-terrestrial networks offering the ability to integrate satellite systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, robotics, and as history shows, those yet-to-be-imagined applications.

<h4 class='specsess-heading'>Synopsis</h4>
<p>
HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) has emerged as a major step forward in video compression and standardization. This achievement was recognized by the Emmy Engineering Award in October 2017.  At the same time new video compression technologies continue being actively developed beyond HEVC to suit the rapidly growing market demands. A Call for Proposals was jointly issued by ISO/IEC and ITU-T in October 2017 to launch a new standardization project to capture these advances. More than 40 responses were received in April 2018, among which some new elements were presented besides more conventional video coding techniques, including the utilization of neural networks for video compression. Neural network or deep learning technologies have been researched for enhancing video and image qualities, and more recently, video and image compression. This talk will look into the recent work on neural video compression for the next video compression standard and discuss the opportunities as well as challenges.
